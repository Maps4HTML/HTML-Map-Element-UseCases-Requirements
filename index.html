This report outlines the use cases and requirements
for standardizing modern Web maps,
in a way that works
for map content authors, webpage authors, and website users.
The use cases and requirements were gathered in
consultation with the Maps for HTML Community Group and others.
</p>
<p>
Three aspects of web maps are reviewed:
map viewer widgets,
client-side mapping APIs,
and
map data formats.
For each, evidence is gathered from widely-used scripted JavaScript web map frameworks.
The common features and limitations of the current techniques
are the basis of the requirements for a standardized solution
that could be built in to HTML and web browsers.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<section>
<h3>The current state of web maps</h3>
<p>
Web maps today are indispensable to billions of people,
for exploring and understanding the world around them.
Like paper maps before them,
web maps are used for planning, wayfinding, analysis, and more.
But the power of an interactive, hyperlinked medium
supports a richer experience than could have been imagined
by a cartographer from a previous century.
Online maps can be dynamically redrawn with new data,
or according to the user's preferences.
They can connect to other maps —
for adjacent areas, finer detail, or different geographical features —
and can link out to complex information about the places they represent.
</p>
<p>
But despite their ubiquity on the web,
maps have no native, semantic representation in HTML.
</p>
<p>
HTML has had “image maps” —
hyperlinked graphics, where selecting different parts of the graphic triggers a different URL —
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866#section-7.6">from its early days</a>.
These were quickly adopted to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110628194820/http://www2.parc.com/istl/projects/www94/mapviewer.html">represent simple cartographic maps</a>.
The <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/image-maps.html#the-map-element"><code>&lt;MAP&gt;</code></a> element
sounds like it should be the basis of a web map,
but its basic functionality
(to define geometric areas on an image that represent distinct hyperlinks)
has not evolved to include many capabilities
that users today expect when interacting with maps on the web,
such as the ability to dynamically change the map view.
</p>
<p>
Web mapping technology has undergone a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_mapping#History_of_web_mapping">long period of evolution.</a>
Today's web maps are usually sophisticated client-server applications,
dynamically combining many types of spatial data on demand for web users.
Implementations vary widely,
but some of the underlying techniques, software, semantics and formats have become
accepted patterns
(for example, <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames">the tile naming systems</a>),
or formal standards
(for example, the <a href="https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards">standards published by the Open Geospatial Consortium</a>,
some of which are also ISO standards).
</p>
<p>
Many sources of spatial data are available online,
from governments, commercial services, and non-profit projects.
But accessing and using the data is a specialized task;
most web developers or website content creators
rely on JavaScript frameworks
(or sometimes still Flash frameworks)
that can fetch the correct map image tiles or vector data,
draw them to the screen,
and handle the most common user interactions.
</p>
<p>
Many of these web map frameworks are tied to a specific commercial provider of map data,
making it difficult for website creators to integrate their own data,
or data from multiple sources.
Many of the web map frameworks do not work at all without JavaScript,
and require considerable resource downloads and processing.
The end user has limited control or customization over the map interface —
unless the website author happened to choose the web map provider
that matches the native mapping application on the end-user's device.
</p>
<p>
Web maps today may not be perfect,
but they have filled a clear need for website authors and users.
The multiple frameworks used to generate web maps
implement the same capabilities with different code —
code that needs to be downloaded and processed for each website with a map in it.
These core aspects of Web maps represent mature, ubiquitous user interface (UI)
and application programming interface (API) patterns.
It is now reasonable to consider standardizing these capabilities
for implementation by web browsers directly.
</p>
<p>
A key challenge is to do so in a way that is
compatible with the core values of the open web,
and integrated with other web platform technologies.

<h3>The Maps for HTML Community Group</h3>
<p>
The Maps For HTML Community Group (<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/maps4html/">Maps4HTML</a>)
arose as a result of face-to-face
<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/maps4html/wiki/LGD14BarCampNotes">discussions</a>
at the Linking Geospatial Data workshop 2014,
co-sponsored by the W3C and the Open Geospatial Consortium.
</p>
<p>
The group operates within the structure of a W3C community group,
with clear license terms for contributions of intellectual property.
The community group process
designed to support the eventual transition of the group's work to become open web standards.
The group attempts to follow the established best practices for web standard development,
as outlined in <a href="#principles">the guiding principles</a> for this report.
</p>
<p>
The initial requirements sketched out at LGD2014
were expanded into <a href="draft-2015.html">an initial use cases and requirements summary</a>.
That work was the basis of the draft [[[MapML]]] specification
and [[[HTML-map-element]]] proposal.
Although MapML has had notable support and development efforts
from within the geospatial community,
as of early 2019 it has not received significant support
from web browser developers or HTML standards teams.
For that reason, the current document rolls back the focus
to the discussion of mapping use cases and requirements.
The structure of this report is intended to more comprehensively explain
<em>why</em> native HTML web maps would be beneficial,
and <em>how</em> they should best be defined.
</p>

<h3>Structure of this report</h3>
<p>
The purpose of this report is to describe
(1) why and how the open web would benefit from having
web map features built in to web browsers,
and (2) what this native web mapping function should look like,
to website creators and to end users.
</p>
<p>
This report uses an empirical approach to identify required features of web maps,
by looking for the common features of web map frameworks used today.
However, we also recognize that web maps today have limitiations.
A proposal for a native HTML web map, built in to web browsers,
needs to be assessed on the same merits as any other proposed web standard.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="#principles"></a>,
we outline the theoretical factors we use
for assessing whether a given feature should be included as a requirement.
In <a href="#js-examples"></a>,
we introduce the web map frameworks that are used in the empirical review.
</p>
<p>
The review of potential requirements
is then divided into three parts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#map-viewers"></a>,
including the user interface
and all configuration that could be defined declaratively
in elements, attributes, and style properties.
</li>
<li>
<a href="#client-apis"></a>,
which would require additional DOM APIs
to enhance or complement the declarative elements.
</li>
<li>
<a href="#map-formats"></a>
that should be supported for representing spatial data
used by the map viewers.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Within each part, we identify potential <dfn data-lt="use case">use cases</dfn>:
problems that a website author or user wants a web map to solve.
The use cases are defined in pragmatic terms,
describing a specific function or action.
Real-world, domain-specific applications of the use case
are summarized in an introductory description.
</p>
<p>
We then list technological <dfn data-lt="capability">capabilities</dfn>:
features, which a web map might include, that could help solve the use cases.
Capabilities are potential requirements for a native HTML web map.
To assess whether the capability should be a requirement, we examine:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Existing implementations</dt>
<dd>
How common is this capability in the reviewed JS web map frameworks?
Do they implement it with consistent, well-established patterns?
Are there any notable limitations of the current implementations,
when measured against the  <a href="#principles">principles of the inclusive web</a>?
</dd>
<dt>Supported use cases</dt>
<dt>
Which use cases are enabled by this capability?
</dt>
<dt>Uses beyond mapping</dt>
<dd>
Is there a demand for this capability on the web,
beyond its use in web mapping?
</dd>
<dt>Related web specifications</dt>
<dd>
How is this capability related to existing web standards
or proposed specifications?
Can the web map implementation build on existing features?
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
For each capability, we conclude by summarizing its costs and potential benefits
(using tags defined in the next section)
for integration as a native HTML web map feature.
We assign it one of three possible conclusions:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><dfn id="requirement" data-ucr-role="conclusion-dfn" data-ucr-tag-type="good">requirement</dfn></dt>
<dd>
The capability is essential for a native HTML web map implementation.
</dd>
<dt><dfn id="enhancement" data-ucr-role="conclusion-dfn" data-ucr-tag-type="caution">enhancement</dfn></dt>
<dd>
The capability would be nice to have in native HTML web maps,
but isn't necessary for the initial specification.
</dd>
<dt><dfn id="impractical" data-ucr-role="conclusion-dfn" data-ucr-tag-type="bad">impractical</dfn></dt>
<dd>
The capability isn't currently realistic for inclusion in native HTML web maps.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
If there is not yet enough evidence for a conclusion,
the capability will be marked
<dfn id="undecided" data-ucr-role="conclusion-dfn">undecided</dfn>.
</p>
</section>

<section id="principles">
<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
<p>
The structure of this review is inspired by many other projects
that have outlined best practices for web standards developments.
This section briefly outlines the principles behind our approach,
with links to further reading.
</p>

<section id="extensible-web">
<h3>The extensible web</h3>
<p>
The report uses an evidence-based approach,
defining requirements not based on hypothetical use cases
but on web map tools that are already in use.
We assume that
the common features of existing, widely-used web map frameworks
represent core functionality
that web users and website authors expect from native web maps.
</p>
<p>
This approach is inspired by [[[EXTENSIBLE]]]
which aims to
“tighten the feedback loop between the editors of web standards and web developers,”
establishing “a clear path for good ideas by web developers to become part of the infrastructure of the web”
[[EXTENSIBLE]].
</p>
<p>
Much of the manifesto focuses on making it easier
for developers to experiment with new features —
to expose web platform capabilities at a more granular level,
so that developers can remix and extend them to try out new ideas.
HTML custom elements and CSS custom properties
are just two of many examples of how web standards efforts since 2012
have focused on creating better building blocks for web developers.
</p>
<p>
But the implicit second step of the extensible web approach
is that, once a consensus has developed from real-world experience
with particular features or patterns on the web,
those features can be standardized with confidence.
</p>
<p>
Web maps are extremely complex user interfaces.
If that complexity is to be built-in to web browsers,
the extensible web mindset requires that it be exposed
to developers as individual capabilities that can be remixed and extended.
For that reason,
this review breaks web map functionality
into very low-level capabilities.
In addition to describing how each capability is used in mapping,
we discuss how the same building block could be used for other web content.
Focusing on these low-level capabilities also ensures
that we do not overlook important details,
such as the need to make individual interactions accessible to all users.
</p>
</section>

<section id="priorities">
<h3>Priorities for web standards</h3>

<p>
To decide whether a capability
should or shouldn't be considered a requirement for web maps,
we need to assess its benefits and costs.
But benefits and costs are subjective:
to calculate them, we need a set of values or principles
defining best practices for web standards.
Only then can we assess whether integrating a feature into web browsers
can bring the web closer to our ideals.
</p>
<p>
Benefits and costs are also different from different perspectives.
Integrating web maps into HTML means convincing
other web standard editors and web browser developers.
But once a web standard is adopted,
the number of website authors who use it will (hopefully)
be much larger than the number of people who worked on the initial standard;
the number of people who use those websites will be larger still.
The [[[html-design-principles]]]
rely on these numbers to establish a “priority of constituencies”:
</p>
<blockquote>
In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity.
…
Of course, it is preferred to make things better for multiple constituencies at once.
[[html-design-principles]]
</blockquote>
<p>
This section introduces the categories by which we measure
costs and benefits to each of these constituencies.
</p>

<h4>Authors</h4>

Website authors include developers who write code

When discussing web maps, website authors also include
geospatial experts who create map data and want to publish it on the web.

For an author that cares about their user,
it of course helps if there are native implementations
of author-focused features like accessibility.

<h4>Implementers</h4>
<p>
Implementers, for a web standard,
are the people who build and maintain web browsers and other user agent software.
Because much of the work of a web browser is to work as the user's agent,
features that are good for the user when it comes to security or performance
are also good for implementers.
But some implementer benefits aren't directly exposed to the user:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>ease of implementation</dt>

An implementation that already exists is always easier.

<h2>Reviewed JavaScript Tools</h2>

Numerous options currently exist for a website author
who wants to include a map viewer in a web page,
with a minimum of custom code.
The examples reviewed in this section are used to identify the common features
(and limitations)
of web map viewers.
</p>
<p>
Many major commercial providers of web map data tiles
provide ready-to-use map viewer widgets for websites to use.
In addition, multiple open source JavaScript libraries
have developed to make it easier for website authors to build on other map data services.

<ul>
<li>
Embeds that are included in a web page as an <code>iframe</code>;
configuration options are set through the URL in <code>src</code> attribute.
</li>
<li>
JavaScript frameworks that dynamically generate the widget within the current HTML document;
configuration options are passed in as JS function parameters when initializing the map.

<li>
HTML custom elements,

<p class="note">
Compiling and serving map data is a complex, expensive enterprise.
Many of the map data and search services
require registered developer accounts, with usage-based pricing.
This review focuses on features that are free-to-use for website creators,
at least for low-traffic websites,
or that use data which is available from many interchangeable sources.
However, because of the complexities of pricing models used by some services,
we don't strictly exclude paid features from our assessment of support.

The map viewer widget is the interactive component that displays a map to end users.
The map might be the primary purpose of a website,
or a small embedded element in a larger HTML page.
</p>
<p>
For this section of the review,
we focus only on aspects of the map viewer
that are generated by the map widget framework
based on initial configuration and data by the website developers.
In other words,
these are the features that could be represented by elements and attributes
in a native HTML solution.
The next section, <a href="#client-apis">on client-side APIs</a>,
covers custom JavaScript manipulation and event handling for the map view.
</p>
<p>
We also skip over the technical details of how the map data is encoded,
and assume the browser can convert the map data into images on screen.
The potential requirements in this section describe ways in which map viewers
enhance the normal experience of viewing a static image (e.g., <code>img</code> element)
in a web page.

<h5>Existing implementations</h5>
<p>

<section id="capability-tile-coordinate-systems" data-ucr-role="capability">
<h4>Display map tiles defined in various common coordinate systems</h4>
<p>
Most tiled image maps on the web use the Web Mercator
system of dividing map data into image tiles.
As the name suggests, this is based on the Mercator map projection,
with the addition of standard for dividing the map into tiles at different zoom levels.
</p>
<p>
Web Mercator is not appropriate for maps of polar regions,
where the Mercator projection distorts geography.
Other tileset coordinate systems have been defined specifically for polar maps.
In addition, many regions have well-established local map grid coordinate systems,
and being able to use the local grid means access to established map data sources.
</p>
<p>
The technological complexity of supporting different projections
depends on how many other capabilities are supported.
Tiling images doesn't require knowing how those images map to geographic coordinates.
But the tile boundaries and coordinate projection are needed
in order to draw marker points or vector features over the map.
And information about the tileset zoom levels is required
in order to dynamically load content on pan and zoom.
</p>
<p>
Combining map layers with different projections,
or otherwise converting one map projection to another view,
is a separate capability, discussed in <a href="#capability-reproject-maps"></a>.

<section id="capability-vector-features" data-ucr-role="capability">
<h4>Draw polygons or polylines as stylable, interactive vector graphics (separate from the image tiles)</h4>
<p>
Polylines are used in maps to draw roads, rivers, directions between places,
or the observed path of a moving object.
Polygons are used for political regions (country and municipal boundaries),
building footprint outlines,
and for contour lines which mark the extent of a certain value within continuous data
(e.g., elevation).
Polygons are also used for roads, rivers and so on at higher zoom levels,
where the true shape of the feature can no longer be approximated as a single line.
They are two of the most common types of map data features.
</p>
<p>
It is common on the web for vector map data to be pre-rendered
into raster image layers on the server.
However, if the vector feature is important for the web view,
drawing it as separate graphic object means it can be dynamically styled,
associated with labels or descriptions,
and the target of user events.

Localized zooming is used on the web for
charts and diagrams,
photographs (e.g., to examine details in a product photo, or for photo editing apps),
embedded documents (e.g., a PDF viewer),
and sometimes data tables.
</p>

<h5>Related web specifications</h5>
<p>
Zooms are often implemented using <a data-cite="css-transforms-1#">transforms</a>,
which defines the scale as a multiplicative factor compared to the normal size
(<code>scale(2)</code> for doubling the size, zooming in; <code>scale(0.5)</code> to zoom out by the same amount).
Scale transforms are paired with translations to create zoom and pan effects.
[[css-transforms-1]]
</p>
<p>
An alternative approach for describing zoom and pan
is used in <a data-cite="SVG2#">SVG</a> <code>viewBox</code> attribute
and in <a data-cite="media-frags#naming-space">spatial media fragments</a>.
In this system, the container element defines its own width and height (e.g., with CSS)
plus a target rectangle in the zoomable graphic's coordinate system
(x and y offset, plus width and height);
the user agent then zooms and pans the graphic
to display the target rectangle in the available space.

<h4>Pan the map display</h4>
<p>
A key part of the interactivity of a web map widget is that the user can change the region displayed.
To pan the map is to shifting the view horizontally or vertically,
so a different location is centered in the map display.
</p>
<p>
For mapping, panning is tightly linked with zooming and with dynamic loading of new content.
For this discussion, we've divided them into separate features
so that the costs, benefits, and non-mapping use cases can be assessed separately.
</p>

<h5>Existing implementations</h5>
<p>The following UI is standard among the reviewed map viewers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag the map view by clicking and holding a mouse.</li>
<li>Swipe the map view with touch gestures.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following UI is available in some viewers, but not all:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pan the map view with arrow keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Many of the maps lack a visible indication of keyboard focus for panning, and do not provide any other affordances to indicate how keyboard panning should work.
</p>
<dl data-ucr-role="implementation-notes">
<dt>openstreetmap-embed</dt>
<dt>mapbox-embed<dt>
<dd><a>supported, with limitations</a>:
Mouse, touch, and keyboard panning are supported; no keyboard focus indication
</dd>
<dt>google-maps-embed</dt>
<dt>google-maps-api</dt>
<dd><a>partial support</a>:
Mouse and touch panning only. Keyboard panning is possible on the google maps web application. Keyboard panning is activated when a specific region of the map is focused.
</dd>
</dl>

<h5>Supported use cases</h5>
<ul data-ucr-role="capability-uses"></ul>

<h5>Uses beyond mapping</h5>
<p>
The standard panning interactions are also common on the web
for other JS-enhanced zoom and pan graphics
(e.g., a close up of a product photograph, a data chart).
Similar interactions may be used in some games,
or in navigation of large spreadsheets.
Creating a native way to trigger panning within a web layout
could help ensure consistent, accessible user experiences for panning.
</p>

<h5>Related web specifications</h5>
<p>
From a rendering perspective,
panning a map is very similar to scrolling a section of a CSS layout.
Important differences:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Although 2D scrolling is supported,
the interaction usually emphasizes a primary reading axis.
Panning is usually 2D, and may be conceptually diagonal as often as horizontal or vertical.
</li>
<li>The initial scroller view is usually at the start of the content (and “start” has meaning);
an initially panning view is often in the middle, with panning in all directions possible.
</li>
<li>Scrollable content is often visually indicated by scrollbars
(although it is now common to hide scrollbars until use).
</li>
<li>The user interactions are different for some input methods:
mouse panning uses click and drag instead of mouse wheel for (primary-direction) scroll,
keyboard panning only uses the arrows, not the space bar and page up/down keys (which trigger scroll in the primary axis).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Panning interactions also overlap with the proposed
<a href="https://github.com/WICG/spatial-navigation">CSS spatial navigation</a> spec.
</p>
<p>
In web maps and many other applications,
panning effects are combined with <a href="#capability-zoom">zoom effects</a>;
for that reason, panning is often implemented using
CSS transforms or SVG <code>viewBox</code>,
which can also handle zoom.
[[css-transforms-1]][[SVG2]]
</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>
Panning the map is universally supported in JS web maps,
and is therefore a <a data-ucr-role="conclusion">requirement</a> for native web maps.
The relevant specification should be coordinated with CSS,
considering other use cases for panning on the web.
Thought is needed on how to make panning accessible to all users.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a data-ucr-role="tag">accessibility-info-needed</a>
  There are no established patterns for indicating that panning is possible.
</li>
<li><a data-ucr-role="tag">accessibility-potential</a>
  Keyboard accessibility is implemented poorly on the web;
  accessible browser implementations would be an improvement.
</li>
<li><a data-ucr-role="tag">implementation-incremental</a>
  Panning builds upon established, highly optimized scrolling mechanisms.

<h4>Display map data attribution and links</h4>
<p>
Map data is subject to copyright,
and use of the maps on the web usually requires at least attribution,
and maybe links to terms of use.
Many map services also include links for end users to report errors.
</p>
<p>
Standard practice in the reviewed web map tools
is to display this attribution in the lower right of the map widget.
For map viewers that provide their own map data,
the links and copyright is automatically generated.
For map frameworks that allow the developer to specify the map data source,
these "attribution control" values can be set in configuration.

Map image tiles are usually defined in Web Mercator

For large scale maps (of the globe or continents),

Many different map projections exist to more fairly display the relative size and shapes of continents on a flat map.
In addition, within an interactive web environment,
it is possible to use projections which more directly represent the 3D globe
without trying to display it all at once,
letting user interaction rotate it to show parts of interest.

<p>
By definition, all mapping APIs support this capability. However, the level
of complexity involved varies.
</p>
<p>
In the simplest cases, specifying a location, zoom level, and DOM node in which
to render the map is sufficient. In others, it is also required to explicitly initialise
a data source such as an OSM tile server, and a view object which implements much of
the low-level functionality concealed behind a higher-level API in the simpler cases.

<h2>Map Data Formats for Map Viewers</h2>
<p>
Many different types of spatial data can be integrated in a web map:
satellite imagery,
cartographic representations of roads and terrain,
3D building profiles,
pinpoint locations with annotated descriptions,
route directions or other polyline paths,
and more.
Many standard and proprietary formats exist to describe this data.
</p>
<p>
A built-in web map viewer will need to work with spatial data
that is already available from web servers,
or that can be provided with minor server upgrades.
