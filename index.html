This report outlines the use cases and requirements
for standardizing modern Web maps,
in a way that works
for map content authors, webpage authors, and website users.
The use cases and requirements were gathered in
consultation with the Maps for HTML Community Group and others.
</p>
<p>
Three aspects of web maps are reviewed:
map viewer widgets,
client-side mapping APIs,
and
map data formats.
For each, evidence is gathered from widely-used scripted JavaScript web map frameworks.
The common features and limitations of the current techniques
are the basis of the requirements for a standardized solution
that could be built in to HTML and web browsers.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<section id="intro-web-maps">
<h3>The current state of web maps</h3>
<p>
Web maps today are indispensable to billions of people,
for exploring and understanding the world around them.
Like paper maps before them,
web maps are used for planning, wayfinding, analysis, and more.
But the power of an interactive, hyperlinked medium
supports a richer experience than could have been imagined
by a cartographer from a previous century.
Online maps can be dynamically redrawn with new data,
or according to the user's preferences.
They can connect to other maps —
for adjacent areas, finer detail, or different geographical features —
and can link out to complex information about the places they represent.
</p>
<p>
But despite their ubiquity on the web,
maps have no native, semantic representation in HTML.
</p>
<p>
HTML has had “image maps” —
hyperlinked graphics, where selecting different parts of the graphic triggers a different URL —
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866#section-7.6">from its early days</a>.
These were quickly adopted to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110628194820/http://www2.parc.com/istl/projects/www94/mapviewer.html">represent simple cartographic maps</a>.
The <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/image-maps.html#the-map-element"><code>&lt;MAP&gt;</code></a> element
sounds like it should be the basis of a web map,
but its basic functionality
(to define geometric areas on an image that represent distinct hyperlinks)
has not evolved to include many capabilities
that users today expect when interacting with maps on the web,
such as the ability to dynamically change the map view.
</p>
<p>
Web mapping technology has undergone a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_mapping#History_of_web_mapping">long period of evolution.</a>
Today's web maps are usually sophisticated client-server applications,
dynamically combining many types of spatial data on demand for web users.
Implementations vary widely,
but some of the underlying techniques, software, semantics and formats have become
accepted patterns
(for example, <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames">the tile naming systems</a>),
or formal standards
(for example, the <a href="https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards">standards published by the Open Geospatial Consortium</a>,
some of which are also ISO standards).
</p>
<p>
Many sources of spatial data are available online,
from governments, commercial services, and non-profit projects.
But accessing and using the data is a specialized task;
most web developers or website content creators
rely on JavaScript frameworks
(or sometimes still Flash frameworks)
that can fetch the correct map image tiles or vector data,
draw them to the screen,
and handle the most common user interactions.
</p>
<p>
Many of these web map frameworks are tied to a specific commercial provider of map data,
making it difficult for website creators to integrate their own data,
or data from multiple sources.
Many of the web map frameworks do not work at all without JavaScript,
and require considerable resource downloads and processing.
The end user has limited control or customization over the map interface —
unless the website author happened to choose the web map provider
that matches the native mapping application on the end-user's device.
</p>
<p>
Web maps today may not be perfect,
but they have filled a clear need for website authors and users.
The multiple frameworks used to generate web maps
implement the same capabilities with different code —
code that needs to be downloaded and processed for each website with a map in it.
These core aspects of Web maps represent mature, ubiquitous user interface (UI)
and application programming interface (API) patterns.
It is now reasonable to consider standardizing these capabilities
for implementation by web browsers directly.
</p>
<p>
A key challenge is to do so in a way that is
compatible with the core values of the open web,
and integrated with other web platform technologies.

<h3>The Maps for HTML Community Group</h3>
<p>
The Maps For HTML Community Group (<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/maps4html/">Maps4HTML</a>)
arose as a result of face-to-face
<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/maps4html/wiki/LGD14BarCampNotes">discussions</a>
at the Linking Geospatial Data workshop 2014,
co-sponsored by the W3C and the Open Geospatial Consortium.
</p>
<p>
The group operates within the structure of a W3C community group,
with clear license terms for contributions of intellectual property.
The community group process
designed to support the eventual transition of the group's work to become open web standards.
The group attempts to follow the established best practices for web standard development,
as outlined in <a href="#principles">the guiding principles</a> for this report.
</p>
<p>
The initial requirements sketched out at LGD2014
were expanded into <a href="draft-2015.html">an initial use cases and requirements summary</a>.
That work was the basis of the draft [[[MapML]]] specification
and [[[HTML-map-element]]] proposal.
Although MapML has had notable support and development efforts
from within the geospatial community,
as of early 2019 it has not received significant support
from web browser developers or HTML standards teams.
For that reason, the current document rolls back the focus
to the discussion of mapping use cases and requirements.
The structure of this report is intended to more comprehensively explain
<em>why</em> native HTML web maps would be beneficial,
and <em>how</em> they should best be defined.

<h3>Structure of this report</h3>
<p>
The purpose of this report is to describe
(1) why and how the open web would benefit from having
web map features built in to web browsers,
and (2) what this native web mapping function should look like,
to website creators and to end users.
</p>
<p>
This report uses an empirical approach to identify required features of web maps,
by looking for the common features of web map frameworks used today.
However, we also recognize that web maps today have limitiations.
A proposal for a native HTML web map, built in to web browsers,
needs to be assessed on the same merits as any other proposed web standard.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="#principles"></a>,
we outline the theoretical factors we use
for assessing whether a given feature should be included as a requirement.
In <a href="#js-examples"></a>,
we introduce the web map frameworks that are used in the empirical review.
</p>
<p>
The review of potential requirements
is then divided into three parts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#map-viewers"></a>,
including the user interface
and all configuration that could be defined declaratively
in elements, attributes, and style properties.
</li>
<li>
<a href="#client-apis"></a>,
which would require additional DOM APIs
to enhance or complement the declarative elements.
</li>
<li>
<a href="#map-formats"></a>
that should be supported for representing spatial data
used by the map viewers.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Within each part, we identify potential <dfn data-lt="use case">use cases</dfn>:
problems that a website author or user wants a web map to solve.
The use cases are defined in pragmatic terms,
describing a specific function or action.
Real-world, domain-specific applications of the use case
are summarized in an introductory description.
</p>
<p>
We then list technological <dfn data-lt="capability">capabilities</dfn>:
features, which a web map might include, that could help solve the use cases.
Capabilities are potential requirements for a native HTML web map.
To assess whether the capability should be a requirement, we examine:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Existing implementations</dt>
<dd>
How common is this capability in the reviewed JS web map frameworks?
Do they implement it with consistent, well-established patterns?
Are there any notable limitations of the current implementations,
when measured against the  <a href="#principles">principles of the inclusive web</a>?
</dd>
<dt>Supported use cases</dt>
<dt>
Which use cases are enabled by this capability?
</dt>
<dt>Uses beyond mapping</dt>
<dd>
Is there a demand for this capability on the web,
beyond its use in web mapping?
</dd>
<dt>Related web specifications</dt>
<dd>
How is this capability related to existing web standards
or proposed specifications?
Can the web map implementation build on existing features?
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
For each capability, we conclude by summarizing its costs and potential benefits
(using tags defined in the next section)
for integration as a native HTML web map feature.
We assign it one of three possible conclusions:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><dfn id="requirement" data-ucr-role="conclusion-dfn" data-ucr-tag-type="good">requirement</dfn></dt>
<dd>
The capability is essential for a native HTML web map implementation.
</dd>
<dt><dfn id="enhancement" data-ucr-role="conclusion-dfn" data-ucr-tag-type="caution">enhancement</dfn></dt>
<dd>
The capability would be nice to have in native HTML web maps,
but isn't necessary for the initial specification.
</dd>
<dt><dfn id="impractical" data-ucr-role="conclusion-dfn" data-ucr-tag-type="bad">impractical</dfn></dt>
<dd>
The capability isn't currently realistic for inclusion in native HTML web maps.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
If there is not yet enough evidence for a conclusion,
the capability will be marked
<dfn id="undecided" data-ucr-role="conclusion-dfn">undecided</dfn>.

<h3>Glossary of key terms</h3>
<p>
Web mapping and geospatial data have a rich vocabulary
that is not always clear to outsiders.
This report uses the following terms in the ways defined here,
unless another meaning is clearly specified:
</p>
<dl>

<dt><dfn>map</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A graphical representation of the features of and spatial relationships between places.
Unless otherwise specified,
maps referred to in this report are assumed to be <a>geographic maps</a>
with a two-dimensional representation.
</dd>

<dt><dfn>geographic map</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A map of part (or all) of the surface of Earth (or another planet),
with a defined mathematical relationship between
positions on the map and geographical positions on the planet.
</dd>

<dt><dfn>non-geographic map</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A map in which positions on the graphic are not defined
relative to positions on the Earth's surface.
</dd>

<dt><dfn>interactive map</dfn></dt>
<dt><dfn>slippy map</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A map rendered as part of an interactive computer application,
such that the user of the app can manipulate aspects of the map display.
In particular, a slippy map is one in which
the user can pan the dispayed map to view a different region.
</dd>

<dt><dfn>web map</dfn></dt>
<dd>
An interactive map integrated into a web page.
</dd>

<dt><dfn data-lt="GIS|geographic information system">geographic information system (GIS)</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A database system for managing geographic data (or other spatial data),
often including software for displaying the data as interactive maps.
</dd>

<dt><dfn>map server</dfn></dt>
<dd>
An internet-connected GIS,
that provides processed geographic data or map images
on request from client software (such as web browsers).
Map servers used by web maps are normally built on HTTP,
but many formats are used for search requests and data responses.
Some of these are described by formal standards,
others are defined only by the documentation of a particular map server.
</dd>

<dt><dfn data-lt="OWS|OGC Web Services|Open Geospatial Consortium Web Services">OGC Web Services (OWS)</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A set of <a href="https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/">standards developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)</a>
that define communication protocols between map servers and client software.
OWS standard define a format for exposing the available capabilities of the map server,
and for structuring requests for map data for a certain region,
possibly restricted by other search parameters.
The format of the returned map data is defined separately.
OWS standards include:
<ul>
  <li>Web Map Service (WMS), for accessing a custom processed map image
    that directly represents the requrested region and query parameters</li>
  <li>Web Map Tile Service (WMTS), for accessing pre-processed map <a>tiles</a>,
    which may only represent a <a>layer</a> of the final map</li>
  <li>Web Feature Service (WFS), for accessing <a>vector feature</a> data</li>
  <li>Web Coverage Service (WCS), for accessing raw <a>coverage</a> data</li>
  <li>OWS Context, for returning metadata with references to other map services</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><dfn>(map) projection</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A method of converting positions on the surface of a sphere (the Earth)
into positions in a 2D rendering (display screen or paper map).
All map projections involve some distortion of the data,
but different projections are preferred for different use cases.
<em>TODO: Figure comparing common map projections</em>
</dd>

<dt><dfn>coordinates</dfn></dt>
<dt><dfn>coordinate pair</dfn> or <dfn>coordinate triple</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A mathematical description of a particular location,
on a map (<dfn>map coordinates</dfn>)
or in reality (<dfn>geographic coordinates</dfn>).
Coordinates are generally defined as a pair or triple of measurements,
depending on whether the location they defining is in two dimensions
(e.g., a location on the surface of the Earth or position on a map)
or three dimensions.
</dd>

<dt><dfn data-lt="CRS|coordinate reference system">coordinate reference system (CRS)</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A standard way of defining map or geographic coordinates,
so that locations can be precisely compared or aligned
between different maps, map layers, or spatial data sets.
Some CRS are based on geographic coordinates,
while others are based on map coordinates
and therefore incorporate a map projection into their calculation.
</dd>

<dt><dfn>latitude</dfn> and <dfn>longitude</dfn></dt>
<dd>
Coordinate system for describing positions on the surface of the Earth.
Latitude values represent North-South distance from the equator.
Longitude values represent East-West distance from a reference line
(the prime meridian) that connects the poles.
Both values are angles, usually degrees.
Latitude and longitude are used in multiple <a>coordinate reference systems</a>;
the exact CRS needs to be specified to define a location precisely.
<em>TODO: Figure of latitude/longitude</em>
</dd>

<dt><dfn>altitude</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A coordinate that represents the height of a point above or below a reference surface.
A <a>coordinate reference system</a> that uses altitude along with latitude and longitude can define geographic points in 3D space.
Altitude is measured in length units, such as meters or feet.
</dd>

<dt><dfn>feature</dfn></dt>
<dd>
Something of interest on the map.
Conceptually, the map feature includes the location or geographic shape
of this spatial thing, as well as additional information
describing what it is or why it is interesting.
This information may be conveyed on the map with text labels
or with icons, colors, or other cartographic symbols.
</dd>

<dt><dfn data-lt="vector|vector feature">vector feature</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A map feature that has a mathematically defined spatial geometry
based on coordinate data.
Different spatial data structures support different types of vector geometry,
but the basic 2D vector feature types are 
<a>point</a>, <a>polyline</a>, and <a>polygon</a>.
<em>TODO: Figure of different types of feature geometries (point, multipoint, polyline, etc.)</em>
</dd>

<dt><dfn>coordinate point</dfn></dt>
<dt><dfn data-lt="point|point feature">point feature</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A spatial location defined by a single set (pair or triple) of coordinates.
A point has no shape or extent,
although in some data formats it may include a level of imprecision or uncertainty.
</dd>

<dt><dfn>polyline</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A vector feature defined as an ordered list of coordinate points,
and the straight lines connecting them.
(Where "straight" is relative to the geometry being described,
and might be across the surface of a sphere.)
</dd>

<dt><dfn>polygon</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A vector feature defined as a two-dimensional shape enclosed by a polyline,
where the last point on the polyline connects back to the first one.
In some data formats, a polygon includes a shape with holes (exclusions) in it,
where the hole is defined by a separate enclosed polyline.
</dd>

<dt><dfn>coverage</dfn></dt>
<dd>
Spatial data that conceptually represents a measurable value that varies across space.
In practice, coverage data is usually encoded as a grid of points
at a specified resolution, with the data value at each point.
This grid of values can often be represented as pixel colors in a <a>raster map layer</a>.
</dd>

<dt><dfn data-lt="layer|map layer">(map) layer</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A subset of the map's graphics which could be rendered independently
from other graphics for the same region.
Multiple map layers can be aligned based on their shared <a>coordinates</a>,
then composited together (drawn one on top of another) to create the final map view.
</dd>

<dt><dfn>base layer</dfn></dt>
<dd>
The map layer that provides the background/bottom layer in the compositing stack.
It is usually fully opaque.
</dd>

<dt><dfn>overlay</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A partially-transparent <a>map layer</a>,
designed to be positioned on top of a <a>base layer</a>.
</dd>

<dt><dfn data-lt="vector map|vector map layer">vector map layer</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A map layer defined using data structures that describe individual <a>vector features</a>
and their coordinates,
which is then used as input instructions to drawing code in the map rendering tool.
Vector formats can preserve the meaning of the different graphical marks on their page,
and allow them to by dynamically styled or altered by the map rendering software.
But, that flexibility requires more processing power in the rendering software,
and may require more data to represent very detailed graphics.
</dd>

<dt><dfn data-lt="raster|raster map|raster map layer">raster map layer</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A map layer defined using raster image formats,
which specify the final colors at each position (pixel) in the rendered result.
Raster maps can be generated from vector data,
or they may be created from photographs or drawings.
</dd>

<dt><dfn data-lt="tile|tiled">tile</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A subset of a map layer that represents a particular region of the map,
usually a rectangle in a particular map projection.
Larger regions of the map can be drawn by rendering multiple tiles
side-by-side in a grid.
In a <a>slippy map</a>, tiles can be fetched from a server and rendered as needed
when the user moves the view to different parts of the map.
Tiles can be <a>raster</a> or <a>vector</a>,
although raster tiles are currently more common for web maps.
</dd>

<dt><dfn>tileset</dfn></dt>
<dd>
A set of map tiles which can be used as a map layer.
In simplest tilesets, the map tiles combine as a grid (<dfn>tile matrix</dfn>) to form a single map layer.
More complex tilesets include multiple tile matrices covering the same regions at different scales (zoom levels).

<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
<p>
The structure of this review is inspired by many other projects
that have outlined best practices for web standards developments.
This section briefly outlines the principles behind our approach,
with links to further reading.
</p>

<section id="extensible-web">
<h3>The extensible web</h3>
<p>
The report uses an evidence-based approach,
defining requirements not based on hypothetical use cases
but on web map tools that are already in use.
We assume that
the common features of existing, widely-used web map frameworks
represent core functionality
that web users and website authors expect from native web maps.
</p>
<p>
This approach is inspired by [[[EXTENSIBLE]]]
which aims to
“tighten the feedback loop between the editors of web standards and web developers,”
establishing “a clear path for good ideas by web developers to become part of the infrastructure of the web”
[[EXTENSIBLE]].
</p>
<p>
Much of the manifesto focuses on making it easier
for developers to experiment with new features —
to expose web platform capabilities at a more granular level,
so that developers can remix and extend them to try out new ideas.
HTML custom elements and CSS custom properties
are just two of many examples of how web standards efforts since 2012
have focused on creating better building blocks for web developers.
</p>
<p>
But the implicit second step of the extensible web approach
is that, once a consensus has developed from real-world experience
with particular features or patterns on the web,
those features can be standardized with confidence.
</p>
<p>
Web maps are extremely complex user interfaces.
If that complexity is to be built-in to web browsers,
the extensible web mindset requires that it be exposed
to developers as individual capabilities that can be remixed and extended.
For that reason,
this review breaks web map functionality
into very low-level capabilities.
In addition to describing how each capability is used in mapping,
we discuss how the same building block could be used for other web content.
Focusing on these low-level capabilities also ensures
that we do not overlook important details,
such as the need to make individual interactions accessible to all users.
</p>
</section>

<section id="priorities">
<h3>Priorities for web standards</h3>

<p>
To decide whether a capability
should or shouldn't be considered a requirement for web maps,
we need to assess its benefits and costs.
But benefits and costs are subjective:
to calculate them, we need a set of values or principles
defining best practices for web standards.
Only then can we assess whether integrating a feature into web browsers
can bring the web closer to our ideals.
</p>
<p>
Benefits and costs are also different from different perspectives.
Integrating web maps into HTML means convincing
other web standard editors and web browser developers.
But once a web standard is adopted,
the number of website authors who use it will (hopefully)
be much larger than the number of people who worked on the initial standard;
the number of people who use those websites will be larger still.
The [[[html-design-principles]]]
rely on these numbers to establish a “priority of constituencies”:
</p>
<blockquote>
In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity.
…
Of course, it is preferred to make things better for multiple constituencies at once.
[[html-design-principles]]
</blockquote>
<p>
This section introduces the categories by which we measure
costs and benefits to each of these constituencies.

Implementers, for a web standard,
are the people who build and maintain web browsers and other user agent software.
Because much of the work of a web browser is to work as the user's agent,
features that are good for the user when it comes to security or performance
are also good for implementers.
But some implementer benefits aren't directly exposed to the user:

<p class="note">
Compiling and serving map data is a complex, expensive enterprise.
Many of the map data and search services
require registered developer accounts, with usage-based pricing.
This review focuses on features that are free-to-use for website creators,
at least for low-traffic websites,
or that use data which is available from many interchangeable sources.
However, because of the complexities of pricing models used by some services,
we don't strictly exclude paid features from our assessment of support.

The map viewer widget is the interactive component that displays a map to end users.
The map might be the primary purpose of a website,
or a small embedded element in a larger HTML page.
</p>
<p>
For this section of the review,
we focus only on aspects of the map viewer
that are generated by the map widget framework
based on initial configuration and data by the website developers.
In other words,
these are the features that could be represented by elements and attributes
in a native HTML solution.
The next section, <a href="#client-apis">on client-side APIs</a>,
covers custom JavaScript manipulation and event handling for the map view.
</p>
<p>
We also skip over the technical details of how the map data is encoded,
and assume the browser can convert the map data into images on screen.
The potential requirements in this section describe ways in which map viewers
enhance the normal experience of viewing a static image (e.g., <code>img</code> element)
in a web page.

<h4>Display a region of map data as a static image</h4>
<p>
Although this review mainly focuses on interactive map viewers,
authors sometimes want a map displayed as a static image, without pan/zoom capabilities.
This is common in cases where the accompanying text
refers to specific features in the map,
or when a series of maps will be contrasted.

<h4>Display map coverages or other custom tile data</h4>
<p>
Unlike map features, which can be defined in geometric terms,
map coverages define continuous variations, and are usually represented as image data.
Many maps of natural features involve coverage data,
such as maps showing vegetation cover, rainfall, or elevation.
</p>
<p>
Map images are also used for aerial and satellite photographs,
and for pre-rendered map tiles generated on the server or in advance.
Custom map tiles — in contrast to map tiles from the major web map services —
are necessary if displaying confidential business data,
maps of proposed developments or historical geography,
or any other type of map not included in the major way-finding street maps.

<h4>Display drawings or schematics without geographic coordinates</h4>
<p>
Many of the capabilities of a map viewer widget —
panning and zooming, possibly with synchronized layers
or dynamically loaded content for different positions or zoom layers —
are useful for non-map content,
or for maps that don't have geographic coordinates.
Examples include technical schematics, blueprints,
data charts,
“mind maps” and other flow charts,
or maps of fictional places.
An author who is familiar with map widgets
would want to reuse the same technology
for displaying these types of map-like content.

<h4>Reposition or scale a map to find more context for the displayed locations</h4>

Users often want more information than is initially visible in a map viewer.

</p>
<p>
This use case exists regardless of how the user interacts with their device.

<li>mouse/trackpad pointer (with or without a scroll wheel)</li>

A map view can't show everything all at once.
Users often want to find more information about the representations on the map.
This information could be presented as details displayed on demand
in a pop-up box or sidebar.
</p>
<p>
The details that are available might include the coordinates of the point,
labels for any features at that point,
metadata or links to further information about the features,
or
local data values for continuous coverage data layers.
</p>
<p>
Some of this information might require querying the server with the selected coordinates.
But to the extent that the information is already available in the map viewer,
it should be accessible by users without the author adding extra features.

<h4>Generate a default map for a given area</h4>
<p>
Often, the website author does not want to specify the map data source or other details about the map;

<h5>Existing implementations</h5>
<p>
The embeds and commerical APIs all provide default street maps

<h4>Draw polygons or polylines as stylable, interactive vector graphics (separate fro4 the image tiles)</h5>
<p>
Polylines are used in maps to draw roads, rivers, directions between places,
or the observed path of a moving object.
Polygons are used for political regions (country and municipal boundaries),
building footprint outlines,
and for contour lines which mark the extent of a certain value within continuous data
(e.g., elevation).
Polygons are also used for roads, rivers and so on at higher zoom levels,
where the true shape of the feature can no longer be approximated as a single line.
They are two of the most common types of map data features.
</p>
<p>
It is common on the web for vector map data to be pre-rendered
into raster image layers on the server.
However, if the vector feature is important for the web view,
drawing it as separate graphic object means it can be dynamically styled,
associated with labels or descriptions,
and the target of user events.

Many map services also include links for end users to report errors.
</p>
<p>
Standard practice in the reviewed web map tools
is to display this attribution in the lower right of the map widget.
For map viewers that provide their own map data,
the links and copyright is automatically generated.
For map frameworks that allow the developer to specify the map data source,
these "attribution control" values can be set in configuration.

The <a data-cite="geolocation-API" data-no-xref="">Geolocation API</a>
and <a data-cite="geolocation-sensor" data-no-xref="">Geolocation Sensor API</a>
expose the user's location using latitude and longitude data.
It should be possible to set the view on a web map using data returned from these APIs.
Both of these APIs use the [[[WGS84]]] as the technical definition
of longitude and latitude (consistent with most modern geospatial standards),
and a web map standard should use the same definition.

<h4>Select map view from street address or place name</h4>
<p>
For many mapping use cases,
a website author won't have exact latitude and longitude values pre-calculated.
They'll have street addresses or place names
in a human-readable, localized format.
To convert these addresses or names into a point on a web map,
the web mapping service needs access to a Gazeteer search and corresponding databases.

<section id="capability-tile-coordinate-systems" data-ucr-role="capability">
<h4>Display map tiles defined in various common coordinate systems</h4>
<p>
Most tiled image maps on the web use the Web Mercator
system of dividing map data into image tiles.
As the name suggests, this is based on the Mercator map projection,
with the addition of standard for dividing the map into tiles at different zoom levels.
</p>
<p>
Web Mercator is not appropriate for maps of polar regions,
where the Mercator projection distorts geography.
Other tileset coordinate systems have been defined specifically for polar maps.
In addition, many regions have well-established local map grid coordinate systems,
and being able to use the local grid means access to established map data sources.
</p>
<p>
The technological complexity of supporting different projections
depends on how many other capabilities are supported.
Tiling images doesn't require knowing how those images map to geographic coordinates.
But the tile boundaries and coordinate projection are needed
in order to draw marker points or vector features over the map.
And information about the tileset zoom levels is required
in order to dynamically load content on pan and zoom.
</p>
<p>
Combining map layers with different projections,
or otherwise converting one map projection to another view,
is a separate capability, discussed in <a href="#capability-reproject-maps"></a>.

<h4>Reproject map tile data into a new projection or globe view</h4>
<p>
Map image tiles are usually defined in Web Mercator
or other grid-based tile systems.
For large scale maps (of the globe or continents),
these reveal distortions created by the underlying projections.
Many different map projections exist to more fairly display the relative size and shapes of continents on a flat map.
In addition, within an interactive web environment,
it is possible to use projections which more directly represent the 3D globe
without trying to display it all at once,
letting user interaction rotate it to show parts of interest.

<h5>Supported use cases</h5>

<h5>Uses beyond mapping</h5>
<p>
Localized zooming is used on the web for
charts and diagrams,
photographs (e.g., to examine details in a product photo, or for photo editing apps),
embedded documents (e.g., a PDF viewer),
and sometimes data tables.
</p>

<h5>Related web specifications</h5>
<p>
Zooms are often implemented using <a data-cite="css-transforms-1#">transforms</a>,
which defines the scale as a multiplicative factor compared to the normal size
(<code>scale(2)</code> for doubling the size, zooming in; <code>scale(0.5)</code> to zoom out by the same amount).
Scale transforms are paired with translations to create zoom and pan effects.
[[css-transforms-1]]
</p>
<p>
An alternative approach for describing zoom and pan
is used in <a data-cite="SVG2#">SVG</a> <code>viewBox</code> attribute
and in <a data-cite="media-frags#naming-space">spatial media fragments</a>.
In this system, the container element defines its own width and height (e.g., with CSS)
plus a target rectangle in the zoomable graphic's coordinate system
(x and y offset, plus width and height);
the user agent then zooms and pans the graphic
to display the target rectangle in the available space.

<p>
This functionality is a <a data-ucr-role="conclusion">requirement</a> for modern web maps,

<section id="capability-pan" data-ucr-role="capability">
<h4>Pan the map display</h4>
<p>
A key part of the interactivity of a web map widget is that the user can change the region displayed.
To pan the map is to shifting the view horizontally or vertically,
so a different location is centered in the map display.
</p>
<p>
For mapping, panning is tightly linked with zooming and with dynamic loading of new content.
For this discussion, we've divided them into separate features
so that the costs, benefits, and non-mapping use cases can be assessed separately.
</p>

<h5>Existing implementations</h5>
<p>The following UI is standard among the reviewed map viewers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag the map view by clicking and holding a mouse.</li>
<li>Swipe the map view with touch gestures.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following UI is available in some viewers, but not all:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pan the map view with arrow keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Many of the maps lack a visible indication of keyboard focus for panning, and do not provide any other affordances
to indicate how keyboard panning should work.

<dd><a>partial support</a>:
  Mouse and touch panning only. Keyboard panning is possible on the google maps web application. Keyboard panning is

</dd>
</dl>

<h5>Supported use cases</h5>
<ul data-ucr-role="capability-uses"></ul>

<h5>Uses beyond mapping</h5>
<p>
The standard panning interactions are also common on the web
for other JS-enhanced zoom and pan graphics
(e.g., a close up of a product photograph, a data chart).
Similar interactions may be used in some games,
or in navigation of large spreadsheets.
Creating a native way to trigger panning within a web layout
could help ensure consistent, accessible user experiences for panning.
</p>

<h5>Related web specifications</h5>
<p>
From a rendering perspective,
panning a map is very similar to scrolling a section of a CSS layout.
Important differences:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Although 2D scrolling is supported,
  the interaction usually emphasizes a primary reading axis.
  Panning is usually 2D, and may be conceptually diagonal as often as horizontal or vertical.
</li>
<li>The initial scroller view is usually at the start of the content (and “start” has meaning);
  an initially panning view is often in the middle, with panning in all directions possible.
</li>
<li>Scrollable content is often visually indicated by scrollbars
  (although it is now common to hide scrollbars until use).
</li>
<li>The user interactions are different for some input methods:
  mouse panning uses click and drag instead of mouse wheel for (primary-direction) scroll,
  keyboard panning only uses the arrows, not the space bar and page up/down keys (which trigger scroll in the
  primary axis).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Panning interactions also overlap with the proposed
<a href="https://github.com/WICG/spatial-navigation">CSS spatial navigation</a> spec.
</p>
<p>
In web maps and many other applications,
panning effects are combined with <a href="#capability-zoom">zoom effects</a>;
for that reason, panning is often implemented using
CSS transforms or SVG <code>viewBox</code>,
which can also handle zoom.
[[css-transforms-1]][[SVG2]]
</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>
Panning the map is universally supported in JS web maps,
and is therefore a <a data-ucr-role="conclusion">requirement</a> for native web maps.
The relevant specification should be coordinated with CSS,
considering other use cases for panning on the web.
Thought is needed on how to make panning accessible to all users.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a data-ucr-role="tag">accessibility-info-needed</a>
  There are no established patterns for indicating that panning is possible.
</li>
<li><a data-ucr-role="tag">accessibility-potential</a>
  Keyboard accessibility is implemented poorly on the web;
  accessible browser implementations would be an improvement.
</li>
<li><a data-ucr-role="tag">implementation-incremental</a>
  Panning builds upon established, highly optimized scrolling mechanisms.

<h2>Client-side Mapping APIs</h2>
<p>
Client-side Mapping APIs (application programming interfaces)
allow website developers to create customized map viewers,
or other geographic applications.
Existing APIs are JavaScript libraries that offer
ready-to-use functions for fetching or rendering parts of a map,
or for manipulating a map-viewer widget.
A built-in web map solution would need to expose similar DOM APIs to JavaScript code.

<h3>Authoring use cases</h3>

<h4>Create, initialise, and display a map</h4>
<p>
An embedded map cannot usually be enhanced beyond the options available via URL configuration,
and it may not be possible to extract additional information from the map or to subscribe to map events.
For all use cases requiring the use of a client API, the first thing the web developer needs to do
is to initialise and display a map.
</p>

<section id="use-case-add-custom-control-map" data-ucr-role="use-case">
<h4>Add a custom control to a map</h4>
<p>
"Controls" are user interface components that appear
overlaid on a map, usually in such a way that no other
content within the map will overlie them.
They may provide user feedback about the current state of
the map, provide one or more affordances for manipulating
the state of the map, or some combination of the two.
</p>
<p>
A web developer may wish to add one or more custom controls
to a map so as to provide capabilities that are not
available within the standard set of controls provided by
the mapping API, or to make up for perceived deficiencies of
the provided controls.
For example, a default zoom control may be inaccessible to
keyboard users, in which case it could be replaced with an
accessible version that utilised a public API to effect
zooming in response to the keyboard.
</p>

<h4>Provide feedback to a user as they manipulate the map</h4>
<p>
A web developer may wish to respond to changes such as
position and zoom level of a map as it is manipulated by the
user, in order to update user interface components
containing information related to the map.
</p>
<p>
For example, an application displaying a list of places of
interest in a city might update the list to highlight those
places that are within the current extent of the map as the
user pans and zooms, or filter the list to only show those
items.
On a device where the user's current location is known, the
distance to the currently-displayed centre of the map, along
with an indication of the user's bearing relative to that
point, could be shown.
If an application is showing a list of items whose
associated locations are represented on the map by markers,
selecting a marker could highlight the corresponding list
item.

<h4>Specify a data source for a map tile layer</h4>
<p>
For a web developer, the API capability of specifying the
data source used by a tile layer on a map allows alternative
tile data sources to be used or, if a map can be configured
with multiple tile layers, displayed in some combination.
</p>
<p>
Common examples include switching between standard map
displays and satellite or aerial photograph views.
More advanced examples include overlaying historic maps on
modern maps with the ability to vary the transparency of the
top layer for purposes of comparison; and viewing maps of
non-Earth bodies such as Mars and the Moon.
</p>
<p>
The user interface for such a capability might be external
to the map, or embedded within the map as a control.

<h5>Existing implementations</h5>
<p>
Implementations differ in how much is expected of the
developer wishing simply to initialise and display a map.
Those APIs that are tightly bound to a single source of
mapping data tend to provide a single method call with
options for configuration, whereas APIs that are data-
provider-agnostic at least require initialisation of data
sources in addition.

<h2>Map Data Formats for Map Viewers</h2>
<p>
Many different types of spatial data can be integrated in a web map:
satellite imagery,
cartographic representations of roads and terrain,
3D building profiles,
pinpoint locations with annotated descriptions,
route directions or other polyline paths,
and more.
Many standard and proprietary formats exist to describe this data.
</p>
<p>
A built-in web map viewer will need to work with spatial data
that is already available from web servers,
or that can be provided with minor server upgrades.
